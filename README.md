Eco-Friendliness Scoring System for Used Cars
Overview
This project applies data science techniques to the car sales domain, focusing on assessing the eco-friendliness of used cars. A scoring system was developed to evaluate vehicles based on key environmental factors. Using clustering techniques, cars were categorized into three distinct groups:

Eco-Friendly
Moderate
High Impact
The project also includes data collection, analysis, and visualization to derive actionable insights for promoting sustainable car purchases.

Key Features
Web Scraping: Extracted car data from the PistonHeads website.
Data Wrangling: Cleaned and preprocessed the scraped data for analysis.
EDA and Visualizations: Conducted exploratory data analysis and visualized key insights.
Eco-Friendliness Scoring: Developed a weighted scoring system based on features like fuel type, engine size, and mileage.
Clustering: Applied KMeans clustering to classify cars into three categories based on their eco-friendliness score.
